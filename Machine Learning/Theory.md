Features: Variables whit which you are going the predict the results.
If the client will buy the product depending on past data whit the same features
<usually first columns in the table>

Dependant variable: Is what you are trying to predict using past data
<usually last column in the table>

- Types of ML algorithms
  - Supervised training:
    Train the model whit data, where we know the correct answer!
    - Regression: a range of numerical data in 'y'
    - Classification: a group of categories [tree, house, rat, etc] in 'y'
  - Unsupervised learning
    analyse and cluster(pair in groups) unlabelled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention
    Works whit un-labelled data, an forms groups based on similarities & is able to identify unknown patterns.
    Work whit big amounts of data, finds patters then makes conclusions.
    - Clustering: forms groups based in similarities, if number of groups is defined, adjust how similar they need to be.
    - Association: allow you to establish associations amongst data objects inside large databases. This unsupervised technique is about discovering interesting relationships between variables in large databases, based on what a person has done, predicts what could do next.
  - Reinforcement learning
    The one used to pass Flappy bird, learn trough errors, 
    Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment 
    Penalty base system!.

<h2>Examples!</h2>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<h4>Overfitting</h4>

When the model performs perfect on the training set but very bad in the test set

Solutions:

- Gather more data
- Reduce noise, remove features whit low importance <P>
- Use regularization

<h4>Underfitting</h4>

Performs bad even in the training set :P

<h2>INSIGHTS</h2>

- On networks whit more than input & output layers

Somewhat confusingly, and for historical reasons, such multiple layer networks are sometimes called *multilayer perceptrons* or *MLPs*, despite being made up of sigmoid neurons, not perceptrons.
