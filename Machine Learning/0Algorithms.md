<h4>Regression °-° Supervised</h4>

Linear regression:
Based on variables on which the desired value depends on, the value is predicted
Most used, due to simplicity and reliability

ARIMA regression:
Uses the auto-correlation regression model
Predicts continuous values based on time-series data, like stock prices!

<h4>Decision Tree Learning °-° supervised</h4>

They are good for either regressions and classifications/clustering.
Used alongside multiple variables

<h4>Support Vector Machines °-° Supervised</h4>

Used to classify data in 2 categories using different types of kernels(a method for classification as Simple linear regression, polynomial regression etc.)
Work on linear & non-linear data sets.

<h4>Association Rule Learning °-° un-supervised</h4>

Used it find hidden pattern in a database!
Works well at prediction future purchased based on past purchases.

<h4>Artificial Neural Networks</h4>

Those that have multiple layers of sigmoid neurons (neurons based on 0.0 - 0.99 instead of 0, 1)
Used for classification & regression whit high accuracy!

<h4>Inductive Logic Programming</h4>

Training models are quite often used for developing this model which is then used to forge relationships between several variables
Used ???
Presents the hypothesis and the background knowledge to create rules, whit logic

<h4>Reinforcement learning</h4>

Trial and error approach & punishment and reward system!
Used on self-driving cars and robots in a dynamic environment!

<h4>Clustering °-° un-supervised</h4>

Groups the data into groups based on similarities it discovers (distance between data, density, etc.)
They are different criteria available to use!

<h4>Similarity & Metric Learning °-° un-supervised</h4>

Sounds like the classification between dogs & non-dogs
The model is provided whit a mix of similar data & dissimilar data, then learns to grab those who were similar.

<h4>Bayesian Networks</h4>

Also called DAG 'cuz represents the probability of various independent conditioned variables.
Based on the principle of disease identification, trough the relation between the symptoms draws a probability relation whit different diseases, Also considers what could have been the source/reason
Also see Deep Bayesian Networks, a more advanced approach.

- Bayes theorem

  ![bayformulae](C:\Users\User\Desktop\Illegal Drugs Accounting!\Machine Learning\src\bayformulae.png)

P(H) = Prior probability of the H/diagnostic being true, before the test/diagnostic/H being created
P(E) = Total probability of the event occurring/prob of testing positive = Lower part of the F(x)
P(-H) = Prob of not having the disease
P(E | -H) = Probability of being falsely accused/identified
P(E | H) = Probability of the event, given the H is true/test positive if having the disease

Example where you feel a little bad and got detected a rare disease, that only happens to the 1% of the population. And the program has an accuracy of 99%

- What are the odds of you actually having the disease/the hypothesis in the event being true?
  After substituting the variables above, we get 9%!!

<h4>Representation Learning</h4>

Help to represent the data in a more structured format
Also allows the model to identify patterns more easily.

This focuses on matching trough different sources, those are most often video, text, audio, and image. The goal of this research is to use these representations for other tasks, such as querying for information
As in video search in YT, they use captions, and descriptions in the videos too train the model!

<h4>Sparse Dictionary Learning °-° un-supervised</h4>

Based on the use of basic functions & sparse as their coefficients
Uses a sparse dictionary whose elements are called atoms...
Used on NN
WILL SE MORE LATER ON 8KOI PLAYLIST!
