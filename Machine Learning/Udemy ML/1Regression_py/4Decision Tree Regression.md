DON'T apply feature scaling for any TREE!! :eight_pointed_black_star:

This predicts continues values! 

The algorithm makes splits whit the aid of mathematical entropy ???

Not well adapted to 1X, datasets!
Use whit dataset whit a lot of X's!!

It was the thing it divides itself under certain parameters and creates end leaf's, and those are used to classify future information

Those divisions classify the new data as the average of the leaf the fall into
