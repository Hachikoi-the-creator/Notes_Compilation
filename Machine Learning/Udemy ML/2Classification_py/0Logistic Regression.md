<h2>When use classification?</h2>

In this example, we get a sample of person who decided to purchase something, respective to their age.

**instead of trying to predict 1 or 0, we try to predict the like hood of 0 or 1!**

<h2>How it works</h2>

Just like that, easy right? www

That green f(x) if sensible of how much data there's in any side of the y axis, thus gets that curved form!
The math behind tho... I ... I'm fine I-I didn't wanted to know, humph! baka~

<h2>Example</h2>

![p_hat](C:\Users\User\Desktop\Illegal Drugs Accounting!\Machine Learning\src\p_hat.png)

**P^ = P hat, P/sombrero!**

That's for probabilities, but to get and actual 0 or 1(Y^ - Y hat), we just divide Y in two, who is above 50% will be taken as 1 and 0 otherwise!
