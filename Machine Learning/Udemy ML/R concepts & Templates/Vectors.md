vector_a  -> c(1,2,3,4)

- You can check the type of elements in a vector by using `typeof(vector_name)`
- You can check the length of a vector by using `length(vector_name)`
- You can access individual elements in the vector by using `[]` and placing the element position inside the brackets. For example, if we wanted to access the second element we would write: `vector_name[2]`. Note: In R, you start counting elements at position one, not zero.
