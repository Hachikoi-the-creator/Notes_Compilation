<h2>Kinds of IA models</h2>

- Dense: every N connects whit everyone next
  <some name>: Dunno
- Deep: Using more than 1 hidden layer
- Feedforward: When the output of a layer is used a direct input for the next layer, no loops
- loops: Where a neuron is activated for a short time, the uses that same output as input later on. -not seen in book-
- recurring neural networks: Cause a cascade of short reactions in the neurons, the short reactions may be available to not crash the computer -not seen in book-
