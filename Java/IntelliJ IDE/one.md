<h2>Change versions and see change-log</h2>

- On top-right select the GEAR icon -> Project structure
  - The section "Project SDK" allows to change, or download new versions
  - The section "Project language level" gives an overview of changes in syntax
  - "Navigate"- Pretty useful to navigate around your code..I guess(?)

<h2>Folder relevance</h2>

- .idea - is where all the default, config and settings of IntelliJ are, no touch 
- out - dir is where the extra packages are, if selected to add them, not important yeet
- src - dir is where all the classes and packages you'll be working on are!, touch it a lot!!!

<h4>Some hacks</h4>

- When the IDE is working weird, not as intended
  go-to top-right -> file -> invalidate Caches
- Go-to presentation mode
  top-right, view -> Appearance -> Enter presentation mode
