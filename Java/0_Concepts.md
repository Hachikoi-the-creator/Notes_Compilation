```java
//Len of an array
String[] arr = {"poop","pee"}
my_len = arr.length //without ()
```



```java
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue :  expressionFalse;		//syntax

int time = 7;
String result = (time < 18) ? "Good day." : "Good evening.";	//Example

```

- Bitecode:
  The "thing" on which the java program is turned by the JRE in order for the JVM to understand it
  
- Compiler:
  Creates the bitecode, The java application is a class file
  
- Source Code:
