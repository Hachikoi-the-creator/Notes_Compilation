- Header: - Before Main - BLOCK
  It's meant to put titles and sub-titles

  Here you usually put the main content of the page, like all the news
  or all the blog post etc.
  
- Footer: - After Main - BLOCK
  Here you usually put your social media, email, phone number etc.

- Section: - Inside Main - BLOCK
  This is used to separate news of the same day, for example

  Gives a useful space in between each other
